## Dear Master&#39;s student, ##

This is a dump of my thoughts on setting up good expectations for your Master&#39;s degree in computer science.

## Why am I writing this post? ##

I have been teaching in the <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at Stony Brook University for the last two years. I noticed that a sizeable fraction of the  international students appear to be under high levels of undue pressure. Some optimize their program too much for short term goals (e.g., landing an internship, graduating within three semesters etc). Having been through this process myself I know firsthand some of the financial and time pressures behind these choices. I also, however, see the bad effects of these choices.

1. Pressure -- Under pressure students seem to cut corners, in some cases even going as far as academic dishonesty. In many cases this is happens even though the students seem well motivated, technically strong, and appear genuinely interested in learning and developing themselves.
2. Long term goals -- Many are not setting themselves up for longer term success. Despite working hard and obtaining technical skills, some don&#39;t seem to believe that they are going to be strong, impactful contributors wherever they go. Somehow they seem to limit their ambitions based on their current levels of knowledge and skill sets.

I have been through a not so great Master&#39;s experience myself because of similar bad choices. In retrospect, I wished I had paid attention to my long term goals more.

### Caveats ###

1. It has been a long, long time since I finished my Master&#39;s. Also I always had a research and academia oriented outlook. So this post can read preachy, vague and out-of-touch with your circumstances.
2. This post is mainly aimed at international students but some of this might apply to domestic students as well.
3. These are my personal opinions and suggestions and should not be taken as official policy or guidance from the department or the university.
4. This is a not a detailed how-to-guide by any means. It is vague. The intention is to prod you to think.
5. I am still new to teaching and advising students. My thoughts are based on my limited view over the last two years. Take this with a big pinch of salt. I plan to do a follow up with more inputs from a diverse group of people, including other faculty and grad students.

If there is one thing that I want this post to do, it is to get you, a prospective/current MS student at Stony Brook, to make a plan for your Master&#39;s overall. Set some goals for what you want to learn from each course that you take. Set good expectations and try your best to meet them.

## Setting up expectations for your Master&#39;s degree ##

A Master&#39;s program in a top department with many wonderful computer scientists and teachers is an incredible opportunity.  Aim big. Set yourselves a high standard for learning excellence. Note this is different from setting a goal of 4.0 GPA.

### 1. It is not only what you learn now that matters. Learning how to learn matters much more. ###

You will learn many CS concepts, algorithms, techniques, computational ways to solve problems, design aspects etc. But what you learn now will most likely become outdated in a couple of years. CS is vast and every area within it reinvents itself every few years. To succeed, you, of course, will need the basic foundations but more importantly you will need to develop skills, and confidence that will let you learn new material on your own. _You should train yourself on how to learn._ I don't know enough about learning theory to suggest any specific learning technique. However, I'd encourage you to set yourself small technical learning goals within the scope of your courses. For example, pick a topic and write a summary of the topic based on what you have learnt. You may have seen many instances of these already. See <a href="http://chetannaik.github.io/">here</a> for an example from Chetan Naik, a recent MS graduate from our department.If going public is an overkill, maintain private notes. I am old fashioned. I do handwritten notes. The main point is for you to becoming confident in your own abilities to master a new topic in a relatively short amount of time. This will give you the confidence to take on new challenges and not feel limited by your current knowledge or expertise.

### 2. Forget grades. (Well, not entirely.) Take a broader view of the classes. ###

Grades exist. They exist for many reasons, the most ideal of which is to provide an assessment of how well you have learnt the subject material in the courses. Setting yourself a goal of achieving a high GPA at the cost of everything else isn&#39;t good. If your semester GPA is 3.0 then you are doing something bad, if you are at 4.0 then you are definitely learning something at least. If you are in between there is cause for concern, only if you aren&#39;t learning or making progress in the areas that you care about. You should be doing well in some courses at least and be average in most. One or two low course grades shouldn&#39;t matter. If you are going to get a solid B+ or an A- in some course, don&#39;t beat yourself up about this.

Use your courses to learn new material beyond what was taught in class. Use the course to understand what makes for a good technique, algorithm, system, design, user interface etc. Different areas and courses value different things.Learn algorithmic rigor, system&#39;s performance focus, AI/ML&#39;s problem modeling/formulations, HCI&#39;s user focus etc. Learn what you worry about as a practitioner in the field. Learn the ideas and where they come from. The specific technical content is absolutely important but the opinions of the instructors -- often leading researchers who have worked on the space for a long time -- are also important. Learn the history of the field. Learn the language, and the common abstractions of the field. Learn to view concrete problems with different lenses. Train yourself to use ideas learnt from related fields (e.g., if you learnt a formalism in AI, ask if that can be used for an NLP problem). Use what opportunities you have within the course structure to communicate your ideas in the language of the field. These skills can help distinguish yourself and help you make impactful contributions. 

### 3. Make a plan. ###

I have come to believe that for almost anything of importance having a plan helps, at least in the placebo sense. Make a plan for what it is that you want to accomplish. Identify skills and learning outcomes you want (look at Forget grades for some ideas) and pick courses that will help you get there. You may want to deepen your foundations, broaden your skills, land a job in the top companies, or prepare for a future PhD. Whatever the objective that led you to choose graduate studies in the first place, take some time to reflect on them. Incorporate what you have learnt since arriving here to adjust your goals.

### 4. Go slow. ###

See if you can do four semesters rather than three. One question I hear often from students is &quot;What is the course structure?&quot; which I think only means &quot;How much work is this course?&quot;. This is an important question to ask but this comes about mostly because students want to be out in three semesters. As a result you may end up not having flexibility in the courses you want to take, or have the room to focus on the courses well enough to learn something meaningful.

You may not be able afford another extra semester in terms of how you framed your finances for the short term. If you took a long term view, you may be able to see that an extra semester you put in here might actually help you get a better start with an insignificant delay overall.

Some students are interested in a PhD but are unsure if they can succeed. If you are one of these students, definitely consider staying longer. Ask around for research opportunities. Work out a plan for research (could be a Thesis option, or an independent study) and pick topics that you can hedge. That is if you decide later that PhD is not for you, your thesis topic should be such that industries interviewing you should view your work favorably and see value in it.

### 5. Talk to faculty, and senior MS/PhD students about your plan. ###

Once you have a plan run it by some faculty member whose area fits with your interests. Talk to any faculty member who is willing to talk to you. Find senior Master&#39;s students, PhD students and ask them for inputs. Most people like to give advice and will be happy to share lessons from their experiences. Some even document their experiences with specific tips. Our CS alum, <a href="http://viveksck.github.io/">Vivek Kulkarni</a> shared some useful practical tips on <a href="https://medium.com/@viveksck/acing-your-masters-at-stony-brook-8d4b92cc49fc">MS in Stony Brook</a>).

### 6. Cheating is unethical. It is also not a good choice. ###

Whatever the reasons or circumstances, don&#39;t cut corners. Academic dishonesty is unethical and is not a good bargain in any sense. If you see yourself getting into a difficult situation, talk to the instructor, in person, if possible. Often instructors are willing to give penalties and accept late submissions. A few points in one homework, or a drop in one point in a grade means very little in the long run.

Sometimes it may not be clear if a certain type of collaboration is allowed for a particular assignment. Please check with the faculty when in doubt. _Here is a preachy part:  Look back at your plan. Check in with your big goals. Cheating won't help you get there_. 

### 7. Enjoy your time here and be an active member in your department. ###

A Master&#39;s degree, especially in three semesters, can be quite tight in terms of schedule, find ways to mingle with the department at large. Go to talks, research group meetings, social activities, and any activity where you can participate. These are all opportunities to meet people, network, and grow both as a computer scientist as well as a member of the larger CS community. I strongly believe that a large part of my CS attitude and integrity -- what I find useful, interesting, and what I think are my responsibilities -- come from the academic institutions that I was a part of and from the people that I met. Being in company of a diverse group of hardworking, successful people is enriching in many ways. I for one learnt to enjoy more things in life -- wine, cheese, cooking, skiing, and running -- and set higher expectations for myself just as a function of being around some wonderful people.

### 8. There are many roads to a good career. ###

Whatever stage of life you are in, the Master&#39;s is a reset button. It helps you launch on a path. Prepare yourself for an impactful long career, rather than for the first job you may want to land with a big name company.

### In short, be intentional: Set your own goals for your Master&#39;s program and try your best to meet them. ###
